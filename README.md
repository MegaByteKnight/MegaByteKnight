## Summary
I am a certified cybersecurity professional transitioning from a project management role in the power utility sector. My focus is on joining a SOC (Security Operations Center) team, where I can apply my skills in network security, incident response, and threat detection. With a strong foundation in cybersecurity certifications and hands-on experience in building and managing secure environments, I aim to contribute to a SOC team by detecting, mitigating, and responding to cyber threats.
